      <content type="html" xml:base="/blog2/staff-intro">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the staff of the UMass Amherst Makerspace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UMass Amherst Makerspace is an interdisciplinary makerspace open to students, staff, and faculty from all majors and disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We provide access to space, tools, equipment, training, and help connect individuals and facilitate mentorship and sharing of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major focus of the makerspace is re-use, repair, and re-purposing. We want to reduce waste and costs by serving as a hub for the community to share used tools, equipment, materials, furniture, and more. Much of what we have has been donated or saved from the campus waste stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UMass Amherst Maker Network is an ongoing project to connect students, faculty, and staff with resources for making all over campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To connect the UMass Amherst maker community with information and access pathways to existing resources on campus, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;facilities and equipment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people and expertise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;workshops, and events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a central All-Campus Makerspace, which will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;serve as a starting point for most makers on campus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provide access to training and equipment for many common maker technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;serve as the campus maker community focal point and host events related to making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our temporary location for Spring 2020 is the Astronomy Building, located near ELab and the Gunness Laboratory at the location indicated on the map above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to visit the makerspace in this location and are looking to plan your visit with accessibility in mind, send an email to &lt;a href=&quot;umamakerspace@umass.edu&quot;&gt;umamakerspace@umass.edu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>
