The UMass Amherst All-Campus Makerspace is an interdisciplinary makerspace open to students, staff, and faculty from all majors and disciplines. We provide access to space, tools, equipment, training, and help connect individuals and facilitate mentorship and sharing of knowledge.

Due to COVID-19, we are going online!

> The UMass Amherst Makerspace provides tools, space, and mentorship to the campus community. It's a place for hands-on learning; for personal and academic projects; for meeting people; and for woodworking, sewing, 3D printing, and so much more. Our collection of tools and our community knowledge base is always growing. Come visit and make something amazing.
